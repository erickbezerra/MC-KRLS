Pieces of the code are from the [Kernel Adaptive Filtering Toolbox](https://github.com/steven2358/kafbox).

### COMMON
- Files that must be at the same folder of the model.

### KRLS / KRLS-T / SW-KRLS
- Models using [ALD-KRLS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1315946), [KRLS-T](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6227361) and [SW-KRLS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1661394).

:warning: The file normalized_dataset.zip is used for every model and contains the normalized historical measures.
